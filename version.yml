  # VerifyMC v1.5.0 Release Notes

  Starting from this version, VerifyMC adopts proper Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Previous versions v1.2.5, v1.2.8, v1.2.10 introduced major features but only bumped PATCH. Historical tags cannot be changed, so we corrected versioning from this release: v1.2.5 = v1.3.0, v1.2.8 = v1.4.0, current = v1.5.0.

  ## Security Fixes

  - Admin login brute force protection (5 attempts per IP / 5 minutes)
  - WebSocket connections now require admin token authentication
  - Passwords stored as SHA-256 hashes instead of plaintext
  - /api/check-whitelist no longer exposes user email addresses
  - X-Forwarded-For header no longer trusted by default (new trust_proxy config)
  - IP-based rate limiting on verification code sending (10 per IP / 10 minutes)
  - Fixed registration race condition allowing duplicate usernames
  - Fixed registration validation order (format checks before DB queries)

  ## Bug Fixes and Improvements

  - Added api-version to plugin.yml to fix legacy material support warning
  - Added Leaves server core detection
  - Fixed Jakarta Mail resource loading in shaded jar
  - Fixed hot-reload resource initialization failure on Paper
  - Fixed regex validation crash on invalid config patterns (fallback to defaults)
  - Daemon cleanup thread for expired tokens, submissions, and rate limit records
